<p begin="00:00:13.860" end="00:00:16.280">About ten years ago when I asked a</p>
<p begin="00:00:16.280" end="00:00:19.580">friend to hold a baby dinosaur<br />robot upside down.</p>
<p begin="00:00:21.830" end="00:00:23.390">It was a toy called plea.</p>
<p begin="00:00:23.450" end="00:00:48.260">All It's a super courts are</p>
<p begin="00:00:48.280" end="00:00:51.650">showing off to my friend and I<br />said to hold it, but he'll see</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.660" end="00:00:52.310">what debts.</p>
<p begin="00:00:55.220" end="00:00:57.010">We were watching the theatrics of</p>
<p begin="00:00:57.010" end="00:01:05.330">this robe that struggle and cry<br />out and and after a few The first.</p>
<p begin="00:01:05.420" end="00:01:08.900">After my little and I said o.k.</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.990" end="00:01:10.580">That's enough.</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.580" end="00:01:15.660">Now, let's put him back down and<br />pepper, about to make it.</p>
<p begin="00:01:15.670" end="00:01:22.700">Stop crying and I was kind of a<br />weird experience for me one thing,</p>
<p begin="00:01:23.020" end="00:01:25.810">wasn't the most maternal person at<br />the time.</p>
<p begin="00:01:26.660" end="00:01:28.910">Although, since then I've become a<br />mother and nine months ago.</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.460" end="00:01:36.120">And that is a score when hold them<br />up to now, but my response to this</p>
<p begin="00:01:36.120" end="00:01:40.030">robot was also interesting because<br />I knew exactly how this machine</p>
<p begin="00:01:40.070" end="00:01:40.870">work it.</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.490" end="00:01:41.840">And yet.</p>
<p begin="00:01:41.870" end="00:01:44.790">I still felt compelled to be kind<br />to it.</p>
<p begin="00:01:46.410" end="00:01:51.280">And that observation sparked that<br />curiosity that I spent the decade</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.280" end="00:01:52.520">pursuing it.</p>
<p begin="00:01:52.930" end="00:01:54.600">Why did they comfort this robe.</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.260" end="00:01:59.950">One of the things I discovered was<br />my treatment of this machine was</p>
<p begin="00:01:59.950" end="00:02:04.420">more than just an awkward moment<br />in my living room that in a world</p>
<p begin="00:02:04.450" end="00:02:09.360">were increasingly integrating<br />robots into our lives and things</p>
<p begin="00:02:09.389" end="00:02:14.020">like that might actually have<br />consequences because the first</p>
<p begin="00:02:14.020" end="00:02:15.530">thing that I discovered is that.</p>
<p begin="00:02:15.560" end="00:02:20.080">It's not just me in two thousand</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.080" end="00:02:20.690">seven.</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.750" end="00:02:22.420">The Washington Post reported that</p>
<p begin="00:02:22.420" end="00:02:26.460">the United States military was<br />testing this robot diffused</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.600" end="00:02:27.310">landmines.</p>
<p begin="00:02:27.420" end="00:02:29.160">We workers were shaped like a</p>
<p begin="00:02:29.160" end="00:02:33.290">stick insect would walk around a<br />minefield on its legs and every</p>
<p begin="00:02:33.290" end="00:02:34.450">time he stepped on a mine.</p>
<p begin="00:02:34.480" end="00:02:35.760">One of the legs would blow up</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.820" end="00:02:40.160">would continue on the other legs<br />to block your minds in the colonel</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.160" end="00:02:44.420">was in charge of this testing<br />exercise for calling it off</p>
<p begin="00:02:45.190" end="00:02:50.060">because he says it's too inhumane<br />to watch this damage robot drag</p>
<p begin="00:02:50.090" end="00:02:58.850">itself along What would cause a<br />hardened military officer and</p>
<p begin="00:02:59.040" end="00:03:02.250">someone like myself to have this<br />response to row.</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.250" end="00:03:03.990">But what.</p>
<p begin="00:03:04.070" end="00:03:05.780">Of course for prime for science</p>
<p begin="00:03:05.780" end="00:03:09.870">fiction, pop culture really want<br />to personify these things, but it</p>
<p begin="00:03:09.880" end="00:03:13.080">goes a little bit deeper than that<br />it turns out that we are</p>
<p begin="00:03:13.080" end="00:03:19.380">biologically hard wired to project<br />intent and life onto any movement</p>
<p begin="00:03:19.380" end="00:03:20.520">in a physical space.</p>
<p begin="00:03:20.520" end="00:03:23.740">It seems I promised us people</p>
<p begin="00:03:23.750" end="00:03:25.860">treat all sort of robots like<br />their life.</p>
<p begin="00:03:26.650" end="00:03:29.400">These bomb disposal units get<br />names.</p>
<p begin="00:03:29.440" end="00:03:33.280">They get medals of honour had<br />funeral for them with gun salutes.</p>
<p begin="00:03:34.850" end="00:03:36.060">Research shows that we do this.</p>
<p begin="00:03:36.090" end="00:03:37.770">Even with very simple household</p>
<p begin="00:03:37.770" end="00:03:39.300">robots like the room.</p>
<p begin="00:03:39.300" end="00:03:40.310">A vacuum cleaner.</p>
<p begin="00:03:41.680" end="00:03:45.450">Just a desk that runs around the<br />floor and clean it just the fact</p>
<p begin="00:03:45.450" end="00:03:48.620">that it's moving around on his own<br />will cause people to name the</p>
<p begin="00:03:48.620" end="00:03:50.620">marimba and feel bad for the room.</p>
<p begin="00:03:50.610" end="00:03:51.730">But when he gets stuck under the</p>
<p begin="00:03:51.730" end="00:03:52.570">couch.</p>
<p begin="00:03:54.540" end="00:03:56.490">We can design about specifically</p>
<p begin="00:03:56.490" end="00:04:01.280">to invoke this response using eyes<br />and faces were movement.</p>
<p begin="00:04:01.320" end="00:04:04.720">People are magically<br />subconsciously associate with</p>
<p begin="00:04:04.730" end="00:04:05.860">state of mind.</p>
<p begin="00:04:06.580" end="00:04:08.100">There's an entire body of research</p>
<p begin="00:04:08.110" end="00:04:10.890">called Human robot interaction<br />that really shows how all this</p>
<p begin="00:04:10.890" end="00:04:11.880">works so.</p>
<p begin="00:04:11.880" end="00:04:12.580">For example.</p>
<p begin="00:04:12.580" end="00:04:15.920">Researchers at Stamford University<br />found out that makes people really</p>
<p begin="00:04:15.920" end="00:04:18.940">uncomfortable and asked them to<br />touch her about his private parts</p>
<p begin="00:04:21.630" end="00:04:23.390">from this from any other studies.</p>
<p begin="00:04:23.390" end="00:04:24.090">We know.</p>
<p begin="00:04:24.480" end="00:04:28.670">We know that people respond to the<br />cues given to them by the lifelike</p>
<p begin="00:04:28.690" end="00:04:29.460">machines.</p>
<p begin="00:04:29.900" end="00:04:31.280">Even if they know that they're not</p>
<p begin="00:04:31.300" end="00:04:31.580">real.</p>
<p begin="00:04:34.490" end="00:04:35.710">We're heading towards a world</p>
<p begin="00:04:35.710" end="00:04:39.570">where robots are everywhere about<br />the technology is moving out from</p>
<p begin="00:04:39.570" end="00:04:44.550">behind factory was entering<br />workplaces households and as these</p>
<p begin="00:04:44.550" end="00:04:45.220">machines.</p>
<p begin="00:04:45.220" end="00:04:47.890">They can sense and make a ton of</p>
<p begin="00:04:47.890" end="00:04:52.160">my decisions and learn enter into<br />the shared spaces.</p>
<p begin="00:04:52.680" end="00:04:54.320">I think that maybe the best<br />analogy.</p>
<p begin="00:04:54.320" end="00:04:57.080">We have for this is our<br />relationship with animals.</p>
<p begin="00:04:57.490" end="00:05:01.640">Thousands of years ago, we started<br />to domesticate animals and we</p>
<p begin="00:05:01.640" end="00:05:05.000">train them for work and weaponry<br />and companionship.</p>
<p begin="00:05:05.640" end="00:05:06.430">Throughout history.</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.430" end="00:05:06.920">We've treated.</p>
<p begin="00:05:06.940" end="00:05:11.330">Some animals like tools are the<br />products and other animals.</p>
<p begin="00:05:11.330" end="00:05:14.300">We treated with kindness and given<br />a place in society as our</p>
<p begin="00:05:14.310" end="00:05:15.180">companions.</p>
<p begin="00:05:15.810" end="00:05:16.700">I think it's possible.</p>
<p begin="00:05:16.700" end="00:05:19.620">We might start to integrate<br />Robartes, but similar weights</p>
<p begin="00:05:23.050" end="00:05:24.180">animals are alive.</p>
<p begin="00:05:24.570" end="00:05:25.430">Robert and that.</p>
<p begin="00:05:27.580" end="00:05:28.940">And I can tell you from working.</p>
<p begin="00:05:28.940" end="00:05:30.520">What about the sister were pretty</p>
<p begin="00:05:30.520" end="00:05:32.040">far away from developing robots.</p>
<p begin="00:05:32.040" end="00:05:35.100">They can feel anything there, but</p>
<p begin="00:05:35.240" end="00:05:40.290">we feel for And that matters<br />because if we're trying to</p>
<p begin="00:05:40.320" end="00:05:43.930">integrate robots into the shared<br />spaces need to understand that</p>
<p begin="00:05:43.930" end="00:05:48.940">people treat them differently than<br />other devices that in some cases.</p>
<p begin="00:05:49.190" end="00:05:52.520">For example, the case of a soldier<br />who becomes emotionally attached</p>
<p begin="00:05:52.520" end="00:05:53.100">to the robot.</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.140" end="00:05:53.590">They work.</p>
<p begin="00:05:53.610" end="00:05:56.980">Well, if that can be anything from<br />inefficient to dangerous.</p>
<p begin="00:05:58.500" end="00:05:59.430">But in other cases.</p>
<p begin="00:05:59.430" end="00:06:00.770">It can actually be used for the</p>
<p begin="00:06:00.770" end="00:06:05.150">faster this emotional connection<br />to, but we're really seeing some</p>
<p begin="00:06:05.150" end="00:06:06.260">great use cases.</p>
<p begin="00:06:06.260" end="00:06:07.780">For example, robots working with</p>
<p begin="00:06:07.810" end="00:06:11.180">autistic children to engage them<br />in ways that we haven't seen</p>
<p begin="00:06:11.180" end="00:06:15.210">previously robot's working with<br />teachers to engage kids and</p>
<p begin="00:06:15.200" end="00:06:20.740">learning with new and it's not<br />just for kids early studies show</p>
<p begin="00:06:20.740" end="00:06:24.400">that we can help doctors and<br />patients and health care settings</p>
<p begin="00:06:24.940" end="00:06:26.910">and this is the pirate b. b. c.</p>
<p begin="00:06:27.010" end="00:06:28.940">But it's used in nursing homes</p>
<p begin="00:06:28.970" end="00:06:33.080">with dementia patients has been<br />around for a while I remember</p>
<p begin="00:06:33.370" end="00:06:34.060">years ago.</p>
<p begin="00:06:34.060" end="00:06:36.440">Being a party and telling someone</p>
<p begin="00:06:36.440" end="00:06:45.890">about this throwback and her<br />response was I can't believe we're</p>
<p begin="00:06:45.890" end="00:06:48.490">giving people robots instead of<br />human care.</p>
<p begin="00:06:50.830" end="00:06:54.720">is a really common response and I<br />think it's absolutely correct</p>
<p begin="00:06:54.930" end="00:06:57.010">because that would be terrible.</p>
<p begin="00:06:57.440" end="00:06:58.460">And in this case.</p>
<p begin="00:06:58.460" end="00:07:02.490">It's not with this robot replace<br />it with this robot replaces his</p>
<p begin="00:07:02.550" end="00:07:06.870">animal therapy in context which he<br />was real animals.</p>
<p begin="00:07:07.230" end="00:07:11.330">We can use robots because people<br />consistently treat them like more.</p>
<p begin="00:07:11.720" end="00:07:16.740">More like an animal and have it<br />acknowledging this emotional</p>
<p begin="00:07:16.740" end="00:07:17.210">connection.</p>
<p begin="00:07:17.230" end="00:07:18.410">Robert, can also help us</p>
<p begin="00:07:18.410" end="00:07:20.870">anticipate challenges as these<br />devices.</p>
<p begin="00:07:20.870" end="00:07:24.980">Move into more intimate areas of<br />people's lives and for example is</p>
<p begin="00:07:24.980" end="00:07:25.070">it.</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.070" end="00:07:25.490">o.k.</p>
<p begin="00:07:25.500" end="00:07:29.180">If your child's teddy bear robot<br />records private conversations.</p>
<p begin="00:07:29.760" end="00:07:29.980">Is it.</p>

<p begin="00:07:36.020" end="00:07:40.180">That's plus capitalism equals<br />questions around consumer</p>
<p begin="00:07:40.180" end="00:07:44.170">protection and privacy and those<br />aren't the only reason, said her</p>
<p begin="00:07:44.160" end="00:07:46.250">behaviour around these machines<br />could, madam.</p>
<p begin="00:07:48.750" end="00:07:51.710">A few years after that first<br />initial experience.</p>
<p begin="00:07:51.710" end="00:07:55.700">I had with this baby dinosaur<br />robot do workshop with her friend</p>
<p begin="00:07:55.700" end="00:07:56.190">Hannah Scott.</p>
<p begin="00:07:56.200" end="00:07:58.670">Scott, then we took five of these</p>
<p begin="00:07:58.670" end="00:08:00.330">baby dinosaur about we give them.</p>
<p begin="00:08:00.330" end="00:08:01.720">The five teams of people.</p>
<p begin="00:08:02.310" end="00:08:07.740">We had the name them and play with<br />them and them for about an hour.</p>
<p begin="00:08:08.800" end="00:08:11.610">Then we unveiled a him or a<br />hatchet and we told them to</p>
<p begin="00:08:11.610" end="00:08:18.290">torture and kill the row and then<br />this turned out to be a little</p>
<p begin="00:08:18.290" end="00:08:21.100">more dramatic than we expected it<br />to be because none of the</p>
<p begin="00:08:21.100" end="00:08:23.560">participants wouldn't even so much<br />as straight.</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.210" end="00:08:24.740">A robot.</p>
<p begin="00:08:24.760" end="00:08:26.260">So we had to improvise.</p>
<p begin="00:08:27.350" end="00:08:28.330">End at some point.</p>
<p begin="00:08:28.330" end="00:08:29.380">He said o.k.</p>
<p begin="00:08:30.070" end="00:08:32.080">You can save your team's robot.</p>
<p begin="00:08:32.110" end="00:08:34.210">If you destroy another team throw.</p>
<p begin="00:08:34.230" end="00:08:37.840">I And anyone that didn't work.</p>
<p begin="00:08:37.870" end="00:08:38.570">They couldn't do it.</p>
<p begin="00:08:38.610" end="00:08:42.500">So finally said, We're gonna<br />destroy all the robots are someone</p>
<p begin="00:08:42.500" end="00:08:44.000">takes a hatchet to one of them.</p>
<p begin="00:08:45.740" end="00:08:47.730">This guy stood up and he took the</p>
<p begin="00:08:47.800" end="00:08:50.520">hatchet and the whole room,<br />Winston.</p>
<p begin="00:08:50.530" end="00:08:54.690">See brother had to down on the<br />robot's neck and there was this</p>
